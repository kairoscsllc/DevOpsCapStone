The purpose of this capstone is to confirm understanding of DEVOPS Concepts using the tools and techniques learned in the Cohort...........

Company Information:
We are a consulting company hired to build custom Selenium scripts for our clients (John Hopkins University and Digital Ocean).

Use case:

Hit the Covid19 public API from John's Hopkins University Hospital to confirm that there is at least 1 case of Covid 19 in a country on each continent.  If so, post a successful message to team slack channel.  Utilize Postman, AWS and Jenkins to confirm this.

This is important to our business because we want to confirm that the API is working correctly as we continue to build custom Selenium scripts for our clients such as John Hopkins University and Digital Ocean. 


TOOLS used

1. Jenkins
2. Python
3. Postman
4. Selenium
5. AWS - Elastic Cloud Linux Servers
6. GitHub
7. Slack


______________________________
The (3) Ways of Devops
______________________________
WAY 1 = Continuous Flow
Utilize GitHub for collabortion so multiple developers can contribute to our source scripts while confirming that the core API is up and running.
GITHUB / AWS / SELENIUM / PYTHON / POSTMAN / JENKINS
______________________________

______________________________
WAY 2 = Amplify Feeback loops 
Utilize Jenkins jobs integrated with GitHub to trigger the API test jobs on commit of a new Selenium Script by any developer.  Post a SLACK message to the team channel when there is an issue so that someone can take a look and be proactive about it before out clients find out.  
JENKINS / SLACK
______________________________

______________________________
WAY 3 = Continuous Exploration / Learning 
Continue to build on scripts and resolve errors posted in SLACK and logs. 
JENKINS / SLACK / PYTHON
